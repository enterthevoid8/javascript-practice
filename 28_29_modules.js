/**
 * JavaScript Modules (ES6 Modules)
 * 
 * JavaScript Modules (ES6 Modules) allow code to be divided into separate files, improving maintainability and reusability.
 * Modules use export to expose functions, variables, or classes, and import to bring them into another file.
 * Each module has its own scope, preventing variable pollution in the global scope.
 * Modules are automatically executed in strict mode ("use strict") and support asynchronous loading with dynamic imports.
 * 
 * Feature          Description
 * 
 * Encapsulation	Each module has its own scope, avoiding global pollution.
 * Reusability	    Code can be shared across multiple files using export and import.
 * Lazy Loading	    Modules can be loaded dynamically with import().
 * Strict Mode	    Modules execute in strict mode by default.
 * Asynchronous	    Supports asynchronous loading, improving performance.
 * 
 * See 28_29_modules directory for example
